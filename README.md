# Bits-Bots-Database
Created a relational database for Bits &amp; Bots supporting virtual inventory, buyer/seller accounts, sales, and feedback operations. Also added some extra functionality not described in the basic requirements, most notably in creating entities for buyers to have a wish list, and to create categories for sellers to place their virtual stores.
